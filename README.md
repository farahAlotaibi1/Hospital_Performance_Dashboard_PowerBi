# 🏥 Hospital Operational and Quality Performance Analysis (Power BI)

## 📊 Project Overview

This is an interactive dashboard developed using Power BI to analyze Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for patient services within a hospital setting. The project aims to measure both operational efficiency and the quality of service provided.

---

## 📈 Key Metrics and Analysis

The dashboard covers the following operational and quality aspects:

1.  Operational Performance (KPIs): Tracking Total Arrivals and Average Length of Stay (`Avg Length of Stay`) to determine resource management efficiency.
2.  Service Quality: Detailed measurement of overall Average Satisfaction, alongside a breakdown of average satisfaction by department (Emergency, ICU, Surgery).
3.  Demand Distribution: Analysis of service demand and the distribution of arrivals across different age groups.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

* Primary Tool: Power BI Desktop
* Data Modeling: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for creating measures (e.g., Average Satisfaction and Length of Stay).
* Data Preparation: Power Query for data loading, transformation, and cleaning.
